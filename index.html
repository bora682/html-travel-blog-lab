        <p>From the stunning views of coasts, island and forest atop of the Cadillac Mountain to the crashing waves at Thunder Hole, Acadia National Park immersed me with the epitome of nature. I hiked the popular Beehive Trail, pedaled along the peaceful carriage roads, and even spotted a seal near the shore. The views from Jordan Pond were breathtaking, and the popovers were worth the hype! Every trail led to a new adventure in this coastal wonderland.
